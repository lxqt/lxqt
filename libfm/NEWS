Changes on 1.3.1 since 1.3.0.2:

* Fixed crash on reload while directory changes (folder might be not ready yet).

* Changed size of large thumbnails to 512 since 256*256 appears to be small on
    hi-res displays.

* Added application/gzip to archivers.list file next to application/x-gzip.

* Added image/x-compressed-xcf to archivers.list file for xarchiver.


Changes on 1.3.0.2 since 1.3.0:

* Fixed launching menu entries shortcuts on desktop which was broken by making
    them all executable in 1.3.0 - those should be launchable still.

* Fixed installing modules into non-standard path: libtool couldn't relink them
    properly.


Changes on 1.3.0 since 1.2.5:

* Added emblem support by reading the "metadata::emblems" attribute provided by
    GFileInfo. The metadata is provided by gio/gvfs and are currently stored in
    $XDG_DATA_HOME/gvfs-metadata.

* Fixed typo: occured -> occurred.

* Made desktop entries treaten as executables. Now clicking on a native desktop
    file opens a confirmation dialog instead of executing it. Trashed desktop
    files are only opened as text files and desktop files under system menu
    (i.e. menu://applications/) are executed without prompt as before.

* Fixed build error with vala 0.36.1.

* Fixed crash on launching nonexistent link targets.

* Added tooltips for attributes of copying files.

* Fixed thumbnails generation for files in the thumbnails cache directory which
    actually should never be done.

* Fixed crash on pasting large string when completion matches.

* Prevented creation corrupted image thumbnails with gdk-pixbuf2 >= 2.36.1.

* Fixed crash in fm_config_load_from_file().

* Dropped displaying "extension" for a directory.

* Fixed crash on pasting a file into the search folder, show an error message
    when the copy destination doesn't exist instead.

* Added new API for FmAction new object type, to replace old VALA-generated
    code. New API is more convenient, C instead of VALA, and should support all
    DES-API specification features, not just limited set.

* Migrated module 'gtk-menu-actions' to new DES-EMA actions API.

* Added display of data transferred to progress dialog.

* Fixed wrong names for files, copied from Google Drive and similar places.


Changes on 1.2.5 since 1.2.4:

* Fixed 'Launch in Terminal' issue when custom args were ignored.

* Fixed crash with non-UTF regex search pattern.

* Added 'termite' into the terminals database.

* Fixed possible crash on FmPlacesView.

* Fixed crash on non-existent directory listing job.

* Added conversion of all URIs schemes to file:/// by mapping them to
    FUSE-mounted local paths if that is possible. This is required for
    non-gio applications to open files mounted by gvfs.

* Added new MIME type for rar files to the archivers.list file.

* Fixed crash in _fm_template_update().

* Fixed incorrect initialization of FmPlacesViewClass, it should not call
    fm_get_home_dir() but initialized with NULL, that will do the same at
    runtime.

* Fixed FTBFS when libmenu-cache was installed to non-standard location.

* Added check for edit name "/" for remote root directory so display name
    should be used in such cases as more sensible one.

* Fixed wrong width requested by FmCellRendererText (1.2.4 regression).

* Updated list of MIME types handled by xarchiver.

* Don't show error message when attempting to rename file into the same.

* Fixed crash after file info job finished on a folder that already left.

* Changed limitations on libfm-pref-apps.desktop to show only in LXDE.

* Fixed incomplete file copy job pausing in some cases.

* Fixed missing 'Empty Trash Can' option in desktop's trash context menu.


Changes on 1.2.4 since 1.2.3:

* Fixed crash in templates on file that was deleted instantly after
    creation.

* Fixed handling %c in desktop entry Exec key: launch may fail if the
    application name contains spaces so it needs quoting.

* Fixed missing folder info update on folder attributes change.

* Use G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD on application launch, that should fix
    a problem with pkexec.

* Corrected missing newline at end of generated shortcut desktop entry.

* Improved file type detection, it failed in some cases such as DOCX.

* Returned back the workaround on thumbnailers which don't save any of
    Thumb::MTime or Thumb::URI in the thumbnail.

* Fixed wrong treating files like ".purple" as having extension "purple".

* Fixed invalid desktop entry save if 'Cancel' was pressed in the file
    properties dialog window.

* Fixed issues on dropping folders into Places for bookmarking them.

* Fixed crash in expand_exec_macros() on missing Exec line.

* Rewritten broken rubberband rendering in icon view for GTK3.

* Eliminated usage of GVolumeMonitor if no FmFolder object was created.

* Fixed renaming of desktop entries on copy operation error: it was the
    file name which was set in renaming dialog but it was compared with
    display name instead when decided whether "Rename" button should be
    active or not.

* Fixed dropping files onto applications shortcuts on the desktop: those
    should be not "inode/x-shortcut" but "application/x-desktop" instead
    and therefore handled as any other applications, i.e. allow drop.

* Added 'urxvtc' into the terminals database.

* Fixed adding user-defined MIME associations into mimeapps.list config.

* Few UI adaptations to work with GTK+ 3.10 or newer.

* Fixed creating shortcuts on paths with basename started with '?'.

* Fixed pointer-related issues with GTK+ 3.10 or newer.

* Added 'terminology' into the terminals database.

* Fixed stuck tooltip on entering empty folder.

* Fixed crash on cancelling FmDirListJob while retrieving is in progress.

* Fixed incomplete cleanup on folder reloading.

* Corrected autoscrolling to position in view to not include extra space
    (so not show all the column/row at once but only fully show exactly
    the item). This may fix a problem with double-click at the end of the
    file name which is already visible so no scrolling is needed, but if
    another file in the column/row has longer name then it could bring a
    scrolling of the column/row, and second click lands out of item area.

* Fixed timer shown in progress dialog, it should show 01:00, not 00:60.

* Fixed stuck tooltip after right-click on file in view, seen rarely.

* Disabled following symlinked directories on recursive search, that may
    give undesired results duplicating files and in some rare cases even
    may lead to endless recursion and endless number of files found.

* Fixed few small issues with icon view interactive search:
    - search should be not activated by space key;
    - cursor was missing in the entry.

* Fixed the background of the name of selected file with GTK+ 3.0.

* Fixed not-ignored invalid Path= line on launch a desktop entry.

* Fixed testing URIs like http://some.host.com for MIME type.

* Dropped using shortcuts to URIs like http://host/ as directories, no
    directory should be in principle used in shortcuts.

* Fixed possible data loss on cross-partition data movement.

* Fixed incorrect data in the search dialog date selection window.


Changes on 1.2.3 since 1.2.2:

* Changed licence for libfm-extra and libfm components from GPL-2 to
    LGPL-2.1.

* Fixed crash on dropping URL queries into some folder.

* Fixed filename on dropping URI queries into folder: URI query like
    http://some.site/path/query.php?new=yes&mine=0 should be never saved
    with file name path/query.php?new=yes&mine=0 but as query.php instead
    like all the web browsers do.

* Disabled debug messages in XML parser, it spammed a lot.

* Fixed content type detection which was broken in last release.

* Fixed incorrect call to g_environ_setenv() in the terminal call.

* Replaced deprecated atk_component_get_position() calls.

* Fixed invalid callback get_image_position() on ATK icon of ExoIconView,
    it could loop and therefore hang the application.

* Disabled deprecated atk_focus_tracker_notify() with new libatk.

* Fixed installation of headers with parallel install, it could create
    invalid symlink /usr/share/libfm/libfm in some conditions.

* Corrected handling of application launch failure - launch content have
    to be informed about failure if startup notify id was retrieved from
    it before.

* Fixed usage of POSIX.1-2001 declaration `environ' with GLib < 2.28.

* Fixed "out-of-tree" build (e.g. make distcheck).

* Corrected menu cache to sync in fm_app_chooser_dlg_dup_selected_app(),
    otherwise it would not work without menu preloaded.

* Fixed launch of applications with %f or %u argument - it should launch
    not just first file but all of them with the same command.

* Fixed unneeded fm-folder-config save even if no changes were made.

* Fixed not updated file in FmFolder if file was not changed within last
    2 seconds. In case of fast download it was not updated in time. This
    may cause a little performance issue though due to thumbnails update.

* Fixed crash if g_file_get_basename() returns NULL.

* Fixed issue with desktop entry file selected in the Application chooser
    dialog, it tried to execute the desktop entry directly. Now it setups
    dialog fields from that desktop entry instead.

* Fixed problem with unwanted application substitution in the Application
    chooser dialog: if user selected no name then no replacements should
    be attempted.

* Fixed default app detection in Application chooser combo box.


Changes on 1.2.2 since 1.2.1:

* Fixed display name of created shortcut after dropping from another
    application.

* Fixed the screen for context in fm_launch_command_simple().

* Added KDE archiver "Ark" into archivers list.

* Fixed parsing order of directories in XDG_DATA_DIRS and XDG_CONFIG_DIRS.

* Added a possibility for application that was started (by PCManFM or any
    other application that uses LibFM) to never die after our application
    (i.e. its parent) was closed.

* Fixed possible memory leak in fm_config_load_from_file().

* Corrected g_content_type_guess() call with file sample. This may help
    with correct file type detection.

* When calculate total file sizes in directory, filesize of directory now
    is skipped.

* Fixed problem with memory consumption in case image has big dimension
    but not so big filesize - in that case loading may consume all the
    available memory to create bitmap. The file dimensions should also be
    checked against thumbnail_max configuration variable.

* Fixed problem with starting custom command from application selection
    dialog. This stopped to work with new GLib versions.


Changes on 1.2.1 since 1.2.0:

* Fixed incorrect presence of LXShortcut in menus.

* Fixed context menu on right-click on column header, it was not always
    shown, especially with GTK3.

* Fixed incorrect mime-type of mount points under computer:///.

* Few fixes in internal thumbnail generator.

* Changed info message on usage of x-terminal-emulator as terminal.

* Added sakura, qterminal and lilyterm into terminals database.

* Don't create ~/Templates if it does not exist on application start.

* Fixed installing extra files with different values for --with-gtk.

* Fixed file renaming if it's name is illegal on destination filesystem.

* An error window after user pressed 'Cancel' on app selection should be
    not shown anymore.

* Fixed menu positioning if it's placed near monitor edge and also on
    non-first monitor, also ensured menu UI update before calculating its
    position.

* Fixed cancellation of loading row after FmDirTreeView chdir.

* The "link" mark on icons of small size (< 20 px) now scaled properly.

* Fixed positioning of search box in ExoIconView widget.

* Fixed fm_terminal_launch(), some terminals need PWD environment set.

* Fixed invalid rubberbanding after doubleclick on ExoIconView items.

* Corrected drag cursor, it should correctly show dragged item icon, not
    generic drag cursor.

* Fixed crash in fm_folder_view_scroll_to_path() if path is not available.

* Fixed unitialized variable usage in folder view context menu positioning
    code.

* Prevented path entry from containing "(invalid encoding)" string since
    it will prevent that path from being used.

* Fixed path completion listing for display names in paths.

* One-time custom application isn't added anymore into list of last used.

* Added a workaround on duplicated loop devices in Places sidebar.

* If quick_exec option is set to true, launching will always start the
    application, not try a terminal for it.

* Changed ExoIconView rubberbanding the same way as it's done in GTK+.

* Fixed invalid renaming files on moving them around virtual FS.

* Fixed crash in vfs-menu module with libmenu-cache 0.3.x.


Changes on 1.2.0 since 1.1.0:

* ABI bumped to 4.

* Added 'auto_selection_delay' option into config file, defaulted to 600,
    which defines interval in milliseconds before folder item is selected
    in single-click mode. Setting to 0 disables autoselection.

* Added 'drop_default_action' option into config file, which defines how
    to act when some file(s) were dropped onto destination widget and no
    modificator key was pressed. Default is 0 (Auto).

* Added 'confirm_trash' option into config file, defaulted to true, which
    defines whether moving files to trash can should be confirmed by the
    user. Previously this confirmation was defined by the 'confirm_del'
    option but now those two are separated.

* Added 'show_full_names' option into config file, defaulted to false,
    which defines whether long names in icon view should be shown as it
    is or truncated to reasonable height.

* The Places View made customizable. New section '[places]' added into
    config file with an option for each standard item (Home, Desktop,
    Trash, and Applications).

* Added new Places View items: File system, Computer, and Network. All
    new items are disabled by default.

* The option 'places_unmounted' in config file defines whether volumes
    from /etc/fstab that aren't mounted should be shown in Places View
    sidebar or not. This option should be not present in the Preferences
    dialog the same as 'advanced_mode' one. Defaulted to true therefore
    default behavior is the same as before.

* Context Menu on folder now available by Ctrl+Menu keypress while the
    selection context menu is available by Menu (or Shift+F10) keypress.

* Implemented reordering bookmarks in Places View via context menu.

* Greatly improved accessibility on every widget.

* Added an option 'Add to Bookmarks' into file context menu. Available
    only if exactly one file is selected and that file is a directory.

* Implemented dropping files onto Directory Tree View (sidebar) items.

* Added terminal list file. There is no need to add '-e %s' or similar
    to 'terminal' config file statement, it will be ignored from now on
    but predefined command line options from terminal list file will be
    used instead.

* Added possibility to keep terminal window open after command execution.
    It depends on chosen terminal though: some terminals allow this (such
    as xterm, konsole, urxvt) but some doesn't (lxterminal).

* Added optional program name for custom application. If no program name
    is entered then application's association with mime type will be not
    remembered and created application desktop entry file will be removed
    from user's applications directory. Otherwise entered name will be
    shown in list of applications for that mime type instead of file name
    (that was old behavior).

* New class FmTemplate for full templates support. Templates support also
    added into folder context menu replacing old hardcoded menu for the
    Empty Text File and Shortcut. To be more lightweight it is created
    once per folder view and isn't updated if user added or removed some
    template while the view window is still opened. If this will cause
    any inconveniences this behavior may be changed but that will make
    the folder context menu less lightweight to appear.

* Added 'only_user_templates' option into config file, defaulted to false,
    which defines whether only user defined templates should be shown in
    the folder context menu or system defined should be shown too.

* Added 'template_run_app' option into config file, defaulted to false,
    which defines whether default application for appropriate MIME type
    should be ran after successful creation of file from template. There
    is also button in the dialog to change this default per creation.

* Added 'template_type_once' option into config file, defaulted to false,
    which defines two modes for templates appearance. If this option is
    set to false then only those duplicates will be ignored which have
    the same file name, and label in popup list will be set to template
    file name without last suffix. If this option is set to true then
    only one template of each MIME type will be shown, it will have label
    from MIME type description. In both cases if any search directory has
    desktop entry matching this template (or template itself is defined
    by the desktop entry file) then value of 'Name' from it will override
    that autogenerated label.

* Added a possibility to have tooltips in popups (GTK itself has no such
    possibility).

* Added menu item "Empty File" back into folder context menu.

* The 'no_usb_trash' option now has default to 1 (true).

* Added support to remember columns width for FmFolverView. The columns
    widths are changeable only in Detailed List View though. Any change
    in columns layout will emit a "columns-changed" signal so application
    may connect handler to it and save columns layout into config file.

* Implemented columns extension APIs which allows application to add own
    custom columns into any FmFolderModel - it registers handler for such
    column and any view which uses the model can use it after that.

* Thumbnails loader code moved from libfm-gtk into libfm. Application
    can use custom image callbacks therefore external thumbnailers can be
    called independent from application-specific image representation,
    thumbnail generator will create thumbnail file and that thumbnail
    will be loaded outside of libfm.

* Setting 'thumbnail_max' to 0 will mean unlimited size from now on.

* Added file properties dialog extension API. Application can add own
    handler to modify file properties dialog for certain MIME type files.

* Implemented file properties dialog extension for desktop entry file
    type - opening file properties dialog for single desktop entry will
    be extended by third tab ('Desktop Entry') with few desktop entry
    properties such as command to execute. Icon also becomes clickable
    (and focusable as well, can be activated by Space key when focused),
    activation will present icon choose dialog. The implementation was
    partially taken from LXShortcut utility. Icon change dialog is also
    available for any single file which allows icon change.

* Disallowed default desktop path (by fm_path_get_desktop()) to be equal
    to home directory since it may be too dangerous. If it is set to home
    directory then it will be shifted to ~/Desktop.

* Added 'shadow_hidden' option into config file, defaulted to false,
    which allows icons of hidden files to be shadowed in view.

* Added GFileMonitor implementation for menu:// VFS.

* The 'Permissions' tab in the file properties dialog will be hidden if
    permissions (owner/group and access flags) aren't available to get
    for the selected file(s).

* Added file operations for menu:// VFS, therefore any application which
    uses libfm can do desktop menu editing. Supported operations are now:
    - create new application in any menu folder;
    - change some application properties (contents of desktop entry);
    - delete some application from menu;
    - move the application from some menu folder to another one;
    - create new folder in the menu (it is hidden initially);
    - delete some folder from the menu.
    Folder creation and deletion operations are disabled if used with
    libmenu-cache older than 0.5.0 because you cannot see hidden folders
    with older libmenu-cache and therefore you cannot see newly created
    folder too (empty folders are hidden from menu in accordance with XDG
    menu specification).

* New class FmXmlFile which is simple container which allows to load and
    parse XML text, do desired changes, and finally compose changed data
    into XML text back. It has very few simplifications:
    - only UTF-8 encoding is supported;
    - no user-defined entities (those should be converted externally);
    - processing instructions, comments and the doctype declaration are
      parsed but are not interpreted in any way.

* Added one more library: libfm-extra. It contains only FmXmlFile for
    now. The purpose for separated library is that it can be used where
    libfm cannot be - for example in menu-cache utilities. This library
    can be compiled separatedly from other libraries, use the configure
    script option --with-extra-only for that.

* Implemented support for hidden menu applications and folders. Those are
    visible in folder view only when 'Show hidden' is on. This will work
    only with libmenu-cache 0.5.0 or newer.

* Default behavior of drag and drop files on desktop is changed: if file
    dropped to desktop is some remote URI (a web link for example) then
    shortcut will be created; if file is a file under home directory (so
    it is most likely some special directory and should be never moved)
    then a symlink will be created; otherwise the file will be copied or
    moved as usual. This "smart link" behavior is applied only if option
    'drop_default_action' is set to 'auto'.

* Added 'smart_desktop_autodrop' option into config file to enable or not
    abovementioned "smart link" behavior. Its default is true to protect
    inexperienced users, the old behavior can be returned by setting this
    option to false.

* Implemented creating shortcuts (desktop entries with Type=Link) so it
    is possible now to drop a link from browser to desktop, for example,
    and that link will be opened with default browser when you click on
    it. And you can edit display name and icon of created shortcut to
    your preference.

* Added basic support for detecting target type of shortcuts. If type of
    target content cannot be determined then content type of shortcut
    will be set to "inode/x-shortcut".

* Added APIs to test possibility and change display name, icon, "hidden"
    attribute of file, and target of shortcut.

* File name is shown if file properties dialog window along with display
    name if it is different from displayable one.

* If access or modification time aren't available for the file then they
    will be not shown instead of stupid "01 Jan 1970" date.

* File can be renamed in the file properties dialog now. The entry will
    be disabled if target file system doesn't support file renaming.

* The "link" icon mark in left upper corner of icon is shown on shortcuts
    the same way as it is shown for symlinks. It is reasonable since any
    shortcut is the same thing - link to another resource.

* New interface for loadable modules (plugins). Modules can be made by
    third party as well. Modules will be loaded on first demand and never
    reloaded so if you add or remove some module then you have to restart
    your application.

* Added 'modules_blacklist' option into config file to disallow certain
    modules to load. The wildcard char '*' is allowed and matches any
    number of characters. To match '*' itself it should be escaped with
    two backslashes (\\), due to key file format. The option is a string
    list, each string may be just a type to blacklist, or type mask and
    name mask, divided by a colon (:).

* Added 'modules_whitelist' option into config file as a exceptions list
    from the 'modules_blacklist' option. Format is the same.

* Created interfaces for loadable modules:
    - vfs (virtual file system)
    - gtk_file_prop (GTK file properties dialog extension)
    - gtk_folder_col (FmFolderModel custom column)
    - gtk_menu_scheme (GTK context menu extension for URI scheme)
    - gtk_menu_mime (GTK context menu extension for file MIME type)

* Moved all VFS into loadable modules.

* Moved desktop entry file properties extension into loadable module.

* Rewritten context menu creation with loadable modules. Loadable modules
    have key either URI scheme, or MIME type.

* Customized Trash Can context menus with separate module.

* Added test if the directory is read-only and update context menus
    appropriately.

* FmPathEntry shows real display name now instead of forged UTF-8 one. It
    is more logical if we enter directory "Multimedia" and end up in the
    "Multimedia" rather then in "AudioVideo". It works for entry path and
    for path completion as well (naturally, it was impossible before).

* The fm_path_display_name() API now returns real display name in most of
    cases instead of forged UTF-8 one.

* Added 'defer_content_test' options into config file which defined if
    deferred content type test should be applied. Deferred content type
    test means the MIME type and icons of FmFolder items will be based
    only on file name for native files but their actual content will be
    tested later, after signal "finish-loading" was already emitted. If
    verified content type differs from early estimation then the signal
    "files-changed" will be emitted later. If option 'defer_content_test'
    is unset then old behavior (emit "finish-loading" only after all the
    info is retrieved) will happen.

* The option 'drop_default_action' is saved in more portable way - not
    the number but text. Therefore if that list will be ever changed then
    it will be still accepted by libfm right way.

* Added support for 'hidden' file attribute into file context menu and
    file properties dialog.

* Added options 'SortIgnoreCase' and 'MingleDirs' into folder context
    menu.

* The FmIcon class is implemented using GIcon instead, greatly reducing
    number of APIs used for cached icons support.

* Implemented extensions for context menu on Sidebar items, similar to
    those that are done for FmFileMenu or FmFolderMenu. Application must
    remember file on which menu was activated and use it in own callback
    if it was activated.

* Disabled attempt to drop files into folders on read-only file system.

* The item "Delete" in context menu now changes appearance between Trash
    and Remove in dependency if Shift key is pressed.

* Implemented little popup menu if option 'drop_default_action' is set to
    'ask' - it shows 'Copy', 'Move', 'Link', and 'Cancel' choices when
    some files are dropped onto widget controllable by libfm drag&drop.

* Added support for <Alt> + drop: it will show the abovementioned menu
    with choices.

* Allowed dropping file into the same directory if 'drop_default_action'
    is set to 'ask' - it shows 'Link' and 'Cancel' choices therefore it
    is possible to create symbolic link onto the file by drag&drop.

* If last access right change time is available for file then it will be
    shown in the file properties dialog.

* Broken symlinks are shown with appropriate icon "dialog-warning".

* Added API to suspend execution of running FmJob. This API applied to
    progress dialog therefore it will be possible to pause and resume any
    file operations jobs in middle. This may be useful in some cases.

* Added 'list_view_size_units' option into config file, unset by default,
    if set then defines which units will be used in the Size column in
    Detailed List View mode, similar to those used in 'du' Unix utility:
    'h' for ISO units, 'H' for SI units, 'k' for KiB, 'm' for MiB, 'g'
    for GiB, 'K' for kB, 'M' for MB, 'G' for GB. If not set then default
    mode (by 'si_unit' config option) will be used.

* Added 'quick_exec' option into config file, false by default. If set to
    true then libfm-gtk will not ask for options on launching executable
    file but will do default action: run in terminal for any executable
    script or run directly for other executable files.

* Implemented hiding items in Places View (Applications, Trash Can, etc.)
    if appropriate support is missing (no GVFS support or no module).

* Implemented advanced version of lxshortcut application as one more tool
    based on libfm-gtk.

* Sealed all the private data in objects. Applications should exclude use
    of sealed data and use accessor functions instead. For old code the
    workaround may be used - define FM_DISABLE_SEAL in compiler options.

* Added 'format_cmd' option into config file. If set then "Format volume"
    option will appear on local non-mounted volumes which allows user to
    reformat USB stick for example. The example of setting for the option
    is "/usr/lib/gnome-disk-utility/gdu-format-tool -d", that will call
    well known component of Gnome Disk Utility.

* Implemented internal workaround for GIO inotify delay - operations with
    files are reflected in view instantly now, without delay of 1 second.

* Added new class FmMenuToolItem - simplified GtkMenuToolButton with only
    menu button arrow without button that it is bound to.

* Applied common human interface guidelines to capitalization of strings.
    Changed some names that might be ambiguous: 'Computer' to 'Devices'.

* Added new object FmFolderConfig for abstract access for folder-specific
    configuration values as key/value pairs (similarly to GKeyFile).

* Added support for adding an optional icon in FmTabLabel before the text
    in the label.

* New API fm_side_pane_set_show_hidden() for change visibility of hidden
    file in side pane (if the mode supports that).

* Implemented support for hidden files in FmDirTreeModel.

* Implemented more flex access to FmSidePane modes to allow extensions
    in the future.

* Added option 'Copy Path(s)' into selection context menu to allow user
    copy text representation of path(s) as simple text list delimited by
    newline into the clipboard.

* Changed search:// paths delimiter to be ',' instead of ':'.

* Corrected strings in the application chooser dialog.

* Config file isn't enforced to be rewritten anymore when fm_finalize()
    is called. The application should control that process instead. This
    will speed up application termination because when config is changed
    then the application will save config. Doing it on exit is a plain
    waste of resources: we rewrite what is already written but spend both
    CPU and disk I/O on it.

* Press <Tab> in FmPathEntry in case if completion ended in single match
    will append a slash to the completed directory name.

* New API fm_side_pane_set_home_dir() for change the directory path which
    will be used on activating 'Home' item in side pane.

* New API fm_folder_view_scroll_to_path() to scroll folder view to some
    path and optionally focus it.

* If files that file properties dialog is open for contain a directory
    then file properties dialog will show file counting progress with
    total number of files involved.

* Added new built-in column in FmFolderModel - Extension (last suffix of
    the displayable name) as alternative to file type for some old-style
    users.

* Search dialog options are remembered now between searches. Search path
    and 'Properties' tab are not saved though.

* Added fallback icons for folder and file in case if no usable theme was
    set in user GTK environment.

* A whole lot of bugfixes.


Changes on 1.1.0 since 1.0.1:

* Added 'no_usb_trash' option into config file, defaulted to 0, which
    defines whether skip trashing files on removable media or not. If
    defined to skip then files will go into "trash-unsupported" and user
    will be asked by fm_file_ops_job_run_with_progress() to remove them
    instead.

* Added 'no_child_non_expandable' option into config file, defaulted to
    0, which adds feature to hide expanders on non-expandable rows so no
    extra 'No Sub Folder' rows are shown. No automation on that is done
    still since it may be expensive sometimes.

* Corrected underscores (mnemonics) on every menu and dialog.

* Fixed GTK+ 3.0 compatibility problems. Libfm can be compiled with Gtk
    2.18 ... 3.x and Glib 2.22+ currently (if glib < 2.26 or vala < 0.13
    still requires run configure --disable-actions). Added new switch to
    configure script --with-gtk=N where N is GTK+ generation to be used,
    may be either 2 or 3. Default is 2.

* Enabled option to Unmount removable media without ejecting it.

* Migrated menu:// support into built-in VFS. There will be support for
    menu editing functions later.

* Added search engine. Supports search:// URIs and has the UI represented
    by API fm_launch_search_simple().

* Full name in Icon View mode now shown in tooltip while long names are
    placed under icons in truncated form.

* Added ability to change columns of view. Works only for Detailed List
    View in FmStandardView widget for now. Implementation for other modes
    and widgets will come later on demand.

* Added a FmSortMode enumerator (similar to GtkSortType) with few modes
    specific fo file manager (ascending/descending is one of new modes).

* Sorting set/get functions moved from FmFolderView into FmFolderModel.
    Sorting isn't remembered by implementations of FmFolderView anymore
    so application should set sorting explicitly after creation of new
    FmFolderModel instance. Previously FmFolderView remembered it and no
    explicit setting was required.

* A lot of lesser bugfixes.


Changes on 1.0.1 since 1.0.0:

* Fixed slowness on loading and changing of very large folders.

* FmFolderView is converted into generic interface. Former FmFolderView
    is renamed into FmStandardView so APIs specific to it have changed
    their names and arguments. Old APIs left for compatibility reasons.
    New FmFolderView interface now contains methods to handle popups,
    keyboard and mouse gestures, including Cut/Copy/Paste operations.

* Fixed compatibility with systems that are a bit old so have neither
    decent Vala compiler nor GLib 2.26.

* Few lesser bugfixes.
