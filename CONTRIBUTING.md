Contributing to LXQt
====================

The LXQt team is always looking for contributors. Everyone is welcome to join,
whether they are a developer, translator or user.


Code contributions
------------------

LXQt uses Git as a version control system. All our code is available online (https://github.com/lxqt).
Pull Requests directly from Github are accepted.

For more information on git, see the official website:
  https://git-scm.com/

Please make sure you adhere to the project's styleguide when proposing changes.

A more in-depth document for aspiring contributors is located on the LXQt wiki:
  https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/Contributing-code

Also see Github's guide on Contributing to Open Source:
  https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/


Translations
------------

We use [Weblate](https://translate.lxqt-project.org) for all our translations. 
QtLinguist will still work.

See further instructions in [wiki page Translation](https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt/wiki/Translation).
