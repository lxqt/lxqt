.SH NAME
startlxqt \- script to initialize and launch LXQt sessions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B startlxqt
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBstartlxqt\fR is a shell script meant to initialize and launch LXQt sessions.
It is as such similar to counterparts of other desktop environments like startlxde in
LXDE or startkde in KDE.
.P
It's main tasks are exporting environment variables, partly after performing
corresponding checks, and launching \fBlxqt-session\fR, the LXQt session manager.
.P
It is not meant to be run by users.
Rather, it is invoked as backend, e. g. by script \fBstartx\fR on virtual terminals or display
managers like SDDM or LightDM, see section \fIEXAMPLE\fR.
.SH FILES
.I $XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/lxqt.desktop
.RS 5
Desktop entry file stating startlxqt as binary needed to start LXQt sessions. Sourced e. g.
by display managers.

to file \fI~/.xinitrc\fR. An LXQt session will then be launched by running \fBstartx\fR.
.P
Display managers are making use of scripts like \fBstartlxqt\fR automatically. Information about
available desktop environments is provided by files \fI$XDG_DATA_DIRS/xsessions/*.desktop\fR, typically
\fI/usr/share/xessions/*.desktop\fR.
.br
File \fIlxqt.desktop\fR provided by LXQt is stating \fBstartlxqt\fR in key \fIExec\fR while making sure the session
manager \fBlxqt-session\fR does exist by stating it in key \fITryExec\fR.
