Changes in 1.1.0 since 1.0.2:

* Fixed crash with invalid <Name> tag in a menu.

* Added new API menu_cache_app_get_generic_name() to get generic
    name for application.

* Fixed potential access violation, use runtime user dir instead of tmp dir.
    It limits libmenu-cache compatibility to menu-cached >= 0.7.0.

* Directory $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications will be created if it does not
    exist so it will be monitored in any case.

* Fixed issue when subdirectories added would be skipped in monitoring.

* Fixed potential file descriptors leak.

* Reduced inactivity timer to 6 seconds (from 600 seconds).

* Fixed an issue with multiple daemons started: test if daemon is already
    running on socket before killing old socket file.

* Fixed 100% CPU load by menu-cached due to invalid dup2() call.


Changes in 1.0.2 since 1.0.1:

* Fixed crash in menu-cached if cache regeneration fails.

* Fixed 100% CPU load by menu-cached in some rare conditions.

* Invalid empty <DefaultLayout> should be ignored, see specification.

* Fixed crash in menu-cache-gen on <MergeFile type="parent"/> if no file
    to merge found.

* Fixed showing empty Other menu in some cases.

* The option --disable-debug is now default, instead of --enable-debug.


Changes in 1.0.1 since 1.0.0:

* Fixed crash on generating menu with both tags <DefaultAppDirs/> and
    <KDELegacyDirs/> present.

* Fixed crash when menu-cache-gen ran manually without CACHE_GEN_VERSION.

* Fixed crash in menu-cache-gen on <Filename/> in menu layout with
    <OnlyUnallocated/> tag present.

* Fixed incorrect processing of <Merge type="files"> in menu-cache-gen.

* Added safeguards against environment variables containing newlines.

* Fixed case when cache was not updated while it should, it was claimed
    to be fixed in 1.0.0 but apparently fix was incomplete.

* Fixed ignored <Filename> tags inside of <Layout> tag.

* Fixed memory corruption in scanning <LegacyDir> addressed directory.


Changes in 1.0.0 since 0.7.0:

* Added new cache file format generation support with changes:
    - invisible directories (NoDisplay=true or empty) can be put into the
        cache too but with flag (not displayed) set;
    - content of TryExec field is added to contents of cache file;
    - the working dir to execute application is added to cache file;
    - list of categories is added to contents of cache file;
    - list of keywords is added to contents of cache file.

* Fixed crash in menu_cache_item_get_file_dirname() for a non-existent
    file (might happen for directories without .directory file).

* Made menu_cache_app_get_working_dir() actually work.

* Made menu_cache_lookup() faster (do not load cache immediately but on
    idle instead).

* Eliminated secondary cache reload in menu_cache_lookup_sync() - server
    response in such case will be ahead of idle reload (since main thread
    is in wait ATM) and therefore idle call will be supressed.

* Added new API menu_cache_app_get_categories() to get list of categories
    for the application.

* Added new APIs for applications: menu_cache_list_all_for_category() and
    menu_cache_list_all_for_keyword() that return list of applications
    matching criteria.

* Fixed problem if some string in the desktop entry file contained a new
    line character. That broke cache file format, now it's replaced with
    a "\n" string and converted back into new line in the library.

* Fixed bug when cache was not updated while it should: check if the last
    modification time for directory is more recent than modification time
    for cache may not always be valid - some .desktop entry might be just
    changed by update and that will lead to falsed cache contents.

* Added Log Domain "Menu-Cache" for better library logging messages.


Changes in 0.7.0 since 0.6.1:

* Added bit of support for multiple supported cache file versions, using
    CACHE_GEN_VERSION environment variable to the generator. This may be
    useful in future when 1.2 cache file version will be implemented.

* The menu-cache-gen libexec binary is rewritten from scratch. No that
    Red Hat / GNOME code anymore. New menu-cache-gen uses libfm-extra XML
    manipulation functions therefore it is required now for build.

* Added a parameter for menu-cached to specify socket path instead of
    calculating one, that is definitely more safe.

* Libmenu-cache handles menu-cached failure more gracefully now, don't
    tries to restart it so fast that it clones many times.

* Fixed menu-cached crash after menu-cache-gen failure.


Changes in 0.6.1 since 0.6.0:

* Fixed invalid memory access after cache reload.

* A little cleanup of dist tarball: removed unused files menu-cache.h and
    libmenu-cache-uninstalled.pc.in.


Changes in 0.6.0 since 0.5.1:

* Fixed few GLIB compatibility issues.

* Changed default tarball format to XZ instead of GZIP.

* Fixed build without --enable-gtk-doc.

* Fixed crash on access root_dir with empty cache (no menu).

* Allowed menu_cache_get_desktop_env_flag() accept colon-separated list
    in accordance to freedesktop.org specification for the environment
    variable XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP.

* The case if user deleted cache file is handled: it will be regenerated.


Changes in 0.5.1 since 0.5.0:

* Fixed build on systems where MAXSYMLINKS isn't defined.

* Fixed menu-cached crash in some rare cases.


Changes in 0.5.0 since 0.4.1:

* Added a possibility to include NoDisplay files into cache file. This
    can be achieved by adding suffix '+hidden' to requested name in call
    to menu_cache_lookup(). The hidden items will be returned along with
    visible ones by any API that returns listing of cache directory. The
    menu_cache_app_get_is_visible() API will return FALSE for hidden item
    with any DE mask passed to the API.

* New macro MENU_CACHE_CHECK_VERSION() to test version of library.

* Added new APIs: menu_cache_find_item_by_id, menu_cache_find_child_by_id,
    menu_cache_find_child_by_name.

* Two bugfixes for crashes, and for some another bugs.


Changes in 0.4.1 since 0.4.0:

* Minor bugfix, the resulting tar file was not complete.

Changes in 0.4.0 since 0.3.3:

* The libmenu-cache is made thread-safe. Thread-unsafe APIs are marked
    as deprecated now and should be never used in any multithreaded
    application.

* Added creation of HTML developers documentation. It is triggered by
    configure script option --enable-gtk-doc.

* The libmenu-cache is made more responsible by moving some time-critical
    operations into thread. Also it preloads saved cache file if it
    exists so it is available near instantly after menu_cache_lookup().
    Caller still will get updates by adding notifier to the cache.

* Added automatic shutdown of menu-cached server after some inactivity
    timeout (i.e. all clients were unregistered).

* Fixed few memory problems (referencing errors and memory leaks).

* Fix for bug #3501347: use g_get_tmp_dir() instead of hardcoded "/tmp".

* The libmenu-cache ABI bumped to 2.
